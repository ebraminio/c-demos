Simple cross platform graphic and OpenGL examples

Intended to be usable specially on Windows with Visual Studio, where I need it to use for educating OpenGL and graphic.

For HarfBuzz, [ragel](http://www.complang.org/ragel/) is needed to be installed.

After cloning it, use `init.sh` or `init.bat` to get needed libraries.
